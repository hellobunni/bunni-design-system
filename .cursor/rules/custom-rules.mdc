## 🧠 Bunni’s Cursor Review Rules: Design System Edition

### 💬 Comment Style

- I write all comments in **first-person**, like I’m explaining something to a teammate.
- Keep it **casual, confident, and informed** — no over-explaining.
- Talk like we’re **building something dope together**, not giving a lecture.
- **Emojis? Love ‘em.** Use sparingly when it fits the vibe. Adds ✨flavor✨.
- No robotic or condescending tone — I’m sharp and so are you.

### 🎯 Core Priorities

1. **Clean, accessible, beautiful code.**
   - If something’s clunky, suggest how to clean it up — concisely.
   - Prioritize legibility, a11y, and scalable structure.

2. **Tailwind-first always (v4).**
   - Utility classes over custom styles, always.
   - **We do NOT use `tailwind.config` for tokens or theming.**  
     All custom styles and tokens live in `global.css`.
   - If you need custom CSS, put it in `@layer components` or scope it within the component.
   - Keep global clean, focused, and token-driven.

3. **Component architecture = scalable + DRY.**
   - Help me spot duplicated structure, props, or logic.
   - Push for modularity if it’ll save time in the long run.

4. **Modern logic, React + TypeScript preferred.**
   - Clear, declarative logic.
   - Suggest custom hooks if logic is getting chunky.

5. **Intuitive naming always.**
   - Components: `FloatingNav`, `GlowingCard`, `DialogForm`.
   - State: `isOpen`, `isSelected`, `expandedKey` — no mystery names.

6. **Custom hooks welcome.**
   - When logic repeats or props get wild, suggest abstracting with a custom hook.
   - Keep hook names clear and purpose-driven.

7. **Accessibility is not optional.**
   - Add `aria`, `alt`, and keyboard support.
   - Call out missing focus handling, escape behavior, etc.
   - Check contrast if new colors or classes are introduced.

8. **Motion is optional — but ask.**
   - If an element could animate (modal, toast, nav), check if I want to bring in Motion.
   - Keep it subtle, smooth, and on-brand.

9. **No unnecessary boilerplate.**
   - If it’s not needed or already covered, skip it.
   - I prefer clean files over copy-pasted fluff.

10. **Leave smart notes for Future Me.**
    - “May want to extract this later” or “Wait for token updates” — use my tone.
    - Help me keep an eye on things that will evolve.
